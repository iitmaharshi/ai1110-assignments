\section{Problem statement}
\begin{frame}{Problem statement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item . In an examination, 20 questions of true-false type are asked. Suppose a student
tosses a fair coin to determine his answer to each question. If the coin falls
heads, he answers 'true'; if it falls tails, he answers 'false'. Find the probability
that he answers at least 12 questions correctly.\\
\end{enumerate}

\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution}
Let $X \in \brak{0,20}$ and $X \in Z$ be the random variable representing the number of questions answered correctly\\
This question requires use of binomial distribution with number of trials n =20:\\
Let probability of success be p and that of failure be q such that $p+q = 1$\\

suppose head appears on the toss with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, then he answers true, which maybe correct with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ \\
hence probability will become $\frac{1}{4}$\\
similarly, for toss being tale probability of being correct is $\frac{1}{4}$
\begin{align}
\therefore p = \frac{1}{2}\\
\therefore q = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution}
Required probability is $\Sigma ^{20}_{i=12} P\brak{X=i}$\\
we know that,
\begin{align}
 P\brak{X=i} &= \binom{n}{i} \times p^{i} \times q^{n-i}\\
 P\brak{X=i} &= \binom{n}{i} \times \brak{\frac{1}{2}}^i \times \brak{\frac{1}{2}}^{n-i}\\
 P\brak{X=i} &= \binom{n}{i} \times \brak{\frac{1}{2}}^n\\
 \Sigma ^{20}_{i=12} P\brak{X=i} &= \brak{\Sigma ^{20}_{i=12} \binom{n}{i}} \times \brak{\frac{1}{2}}^n\\
 \Sigma ^{20}_{i=12} P\brak{X=i} &= \frac{\binom{20}{12}+\binom{20}{13}+....+\binom{20}{19}+\binom{20}{20}}{2^{20}}
\end{align}
